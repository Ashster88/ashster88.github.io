    <h1>My name is Ashraf Shawwa</h1>
    <p>So my real name is Ashraf Shawwa, but everyone calls me Ash.  A little bit about me, I'm 34 and I speak a few languages; english being the strongest, after that arabic, and as a recently married man to a Puerto Rican I am currently learning spanish.  I believe the more you learn, the more you earn.  Earnings, in my humble opinion, is more than just a networth, but can be more friendships, more companionships, and the ability to communicate to others in a way that brings ease to the heart.</p>
